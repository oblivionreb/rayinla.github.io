Hello I'm Raji Ayinla. I'm a hobbyist coder and serial writer. I designed this website and wrote these articles to teach others how to code this mystical language called JavaScript. When I was first learning to code, I was frustrated by the lack of practical articles. The articles that did go in depth usually were too advanced and the ones that took their time didn't really explore more of the langugae. I always wanted to have everything I needed on one website. I wanted artciles that were well explained and used good analogies to allow me to visualize the concepts. 

I believe this website would've helped past me. As a Dev Bootcamp graduate who has a degree in English, I believe that I can communicate tough ideas in a way that everyone can understand--be they novice or experienced. Feel free to ask for help, because your voice will only improve this website as it continues to grow. 

Happy coding,

Raji Ayinla.
