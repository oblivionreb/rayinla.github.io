3 Ways To Make Money With Open Source
===========

Those who want to get started in open source often want to know how open source makes money. Here's how open source makes money in a nutshell: donations, paid support, and dual licencing. 

We'll describe each of these threee categories, but first let's explore the history of open source. If you don't want to do that, you can just skip over to the ways open source makes money.

The philosophy of open source dates back to the early era of computing, where programmers shared ideas in order to maximize the limits of the first computers. There was a collegiate atmosphere in the field of software development that trumped ideas over monetization. However, when computers became mainstream, commercialized software that would run on those computers threatened to cut off collaboration. It would be corporations who held a monopoly on code and ideas. 

The Open Software Initiative was founded in 1998 to combat that problem. The idea was that source code would be shared to the public for free. The public would then be able to use and distribute the code with little to no restrictions. 

But free access does not mean open source software has to be free of cost. There are ways to alleviate the pressure of having to continuously maintain projects that suck valuable time away, time you’re happy to share, but time nonetheless. The problem arises when money is introduced to a community that balks at the mention of commercialism as it pertains to open source. Henry Zhu, the maintainer of Babel, countered the “freemium” ideology in an excellent TechCrunch article written months ago when he said, “We trust startups with millions of VC money and encourage a culture of ‘failing fast,’ yet somehow the idea of giving to volunteers who may have showed years of dedication is undesirable?”

In response to burnout, large open source repositories like Babel that take on a core group of maintainers have turned to sources of revenue that can co-exist with the open source creed. There are three major ways to fund your open source project.

<h2> The Ways Open Source Makes Money </h2>

<h3> Donations </h3>
Henry Zhu rightly mentioned the contradiction within the VC-backed startup culture where millions are poured into failing companies while large, proven open source projects are forced to gather whatever comes to them in the way of donations. On the other hand, the nature of donations have changed because of services like Kickstarter and GoFundMe. While these sites cater more to commercial products, an innovative open source project can take advantage of crowdsourcing  by linking its Kickstarter or GoFundMe account within its GitHub page. 
This may not seem to much different from the usual “pay for my coffee” Paypal donations at first, but many projects don’t detail why donations are needed. Many users think that projects are maintained by a horde of developers who have plenty of time to spare on these projects. A well constructed pitch can have the potential to fuel contributions from large companies who would like to use the software.

<h3>Support</h3>
Providing paid support would be the next step in terms of monetization depending on the size of the project. You can offer your expertise as a service for companies who don’t want to have their engineers run through the source code. You can provide installation, usage, and troubleshooting services to the company. The issue with this method of monetization is that it doesn’t scale. Someone has to take time away from maintaining the code base to help several clients. There is a solution to the problem. Tidelift, a company founded by serial open source investor, Donald Fischer, handles the commercialization of the open source software by providing guaranteed debugging and long term support. While Tidelift handles monetizing enterprise-level support, the maintainers can focus on maintaining. At the moment Tidelift only handles projects built with JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

<h3>Dual licensing </h3>
The concept behind dual licensing isn’t new. Software companies often offer a free version for casual users and a paid version for enterprises. The same idea can be applied to open source software. The open source philosophy can be applied to individual users who may use the software without the intention to monetize any application built with the software while anyone who wants to use the software for commercial purposes would have to pay a fee. Licence Zero streamlines this process by providing two licence options: the prosperity and parity licenses. The former allows a 32 day free trial for commercial users while the latter forces the commercial user to open source their software. Either way, the idea is to make sure those who can afford to support the open source project do so. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Open source projects require the same open spirit within finance. In order for the best projects to continue to thrive, we need to find ways to fund them while still maintaining open source principles. The goal of open source was to provide code that can be shared by other coders. Now that developers have become  increasingly been dependent on repositories like Babel, the balance has shifted somewhat and has made some projects more of a service than a collaboration. To establish balance, projects have to acquire donations, offer support, or creatively licence their service.
